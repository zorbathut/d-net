---- Major work path
- Dual weapon
  - Better control config
  - "Switch mode" in buying screen
- New tanks, "tank base weapon"
- Certificates and discounts
- Training
- Next generation of weapons
- Faction info screen on startup
- Improve explosion effects (missile, etc)
- Speed up wall difference in nasty situations (i.e. glory devices in corners)
- Speed up wall placement in all situations (that annoying caching thing with gamemap, I guess)
- Make explosion removals include the focus point
- AI shouldn't try to buy the glory device it already owns
- Scrollable bars
- Multishop
- Weapon info screen
- Weapon change system
- OSD for weapon type
- Many many more weapons

---- Things that take thought and musing
- See if I can make the config screen a bit simpler somehow
- Improved win sum system
- Slide-along-walls track simulation?

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- gfxeffects "life" in seconds, not frames
- gfxeffects construction helper funcs
- Auto coord-to-float converter (CoordFloat?)
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon
- Color for projectile impacts

---- Major but unimportant
- Halos?
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Level save snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
- dnd compression - this is going to rely on level save snapshots
