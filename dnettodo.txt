---- Major work path
- Pull glory explody into its own deploy
- Next-gen weapons
- Training
- Implants
- Activate factions
  - Faction bonuses/penalties in demo screens
- Many many more weapons
- Make small text thicker

---- Things that take thought and musing
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Cached shop demo stats
  - This is problematic because of all the various adjustments that can be on weapons
    - Record warhead impacts, replay?
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon
- Color for projectile impacts

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Add tank sell depreciation
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

Abilities

Every faction is made up of up to 5 modifiers, and we just store those. Reasonable? Absolutely!
