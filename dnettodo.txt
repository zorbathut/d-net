---- Major work path
- "Finish the Damn Game" Initiative
  - slow down faction tanks similarly to faction armor

    - Add implementations for all trap weapons
      - Hunter/Killer: I need a new projectile for this.
      - Tailwind Blast: Should spawn from centroid and sweep backwards, accelerating, with a triangle projectile.
      - I think I need a way of determining projectile look. Maybe an optional set of enums for look? "Default", "Angled", with angled having width, height, and spin rate. Angled not allowed with mine projectiles or DPS projectiles, of course.
    - Add implementations for all exotic weapons
    - Re-enable weapon checks
    - Add trap behavior
    - Add exotic behavior
    - Add glory behavior

    - Add sparker behavior
    - Special autocannon
    - Special laser
    - Special missile
    - OGRE
  - Make It Pretty
    - Add both "proportion" and "multiplier" merge options
    - Add wall-destruction sizes to the balance sheet
    - Spruce up sparker weaponry

    - Spruce up base missile weaponry
    - Spruce up special missile weaponry
    - Spruce up glory devices
    - Spruce up trap weaponry
    - Spruce up exotic weaponry
    - Spruce up OGRE
  - Eventual bugfixes
    - add flags to dump file
    - Start with level 3
    - End with level 5
    - Auto-equip the first weapon, auto-equip things into damage-type slots?
    - Clean up implant interface a bit
    - Add implant costs to the balance sheet
    - Add tank bonuses to the balance sheet
    - Rewrite faction flavor text if needed
    - Write a better allocator
      - Slowdown with lots of weapons?
    - Lever tanks off walls when they turn?
    - Remove bombardment level visualization, and de-integer it
    - Get rid of old weapons as they become obsolete
    - Add commas to large numbers in shop info
    - Add level editor options for subtraction, fix spiney and re-add
    - Pacman scale up 20% or so
    - Better implant interface

    - Network
    - Singleplayer

- "Polish the Damn Interface" Initiative
  - Fix config, again
    - Remove tank, absolute
    - Put in recommendations for split-axis
  - Four-weapon system
    - Figure out how to equip stuff well?
  - Colorcode tanks, based on relative tank level
  - vecedit should drag around with the right mouse button or whatever
  - walls that are more easily destroyed
  - support for really thin walls
  - More permissive levels, more powerful editor catchall
    - Figure out how and when I can do genus-n levels, and allow that in one way or another (possibly chopping holey things in half?)
    - Allow subtractives
    - Try rebuilding the intersection system again? :/
    - Allow rings of some kind?
  - Add warning for single-node paths

- I really hate naming things
  - Exotic: Brownian

- Run header culler again :D
- Netplay
- Add accuracy implant/upgrade?
- Less incentive to camp?
  - Reduce win/kill bonus as game goes on
- New game modes
  - Arcade mode
  - Alliance mode? Faction mode?
  - CTF
  - King of the Hill
  - Mutant
  - Onslaught
  - Bombing Run

---- After I figure out where it's going
- Need to sit down and rewrite the shop interface again.
  - Restricted speed/turn for the better tanks
    - Roll speed and handling together? Otherwise, come up with a description for the implant
    - "fast turn" "slow turn" modifier buttons?
  - Category descriptions somehow?

---- Sound-related stuff
- Need sound for game start sliders
- Need choose.wav and cursorover.wav
- accept.wav seems to start too late
- Eventually get things like weaponry sounds in

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Jittered tank could end up inside a wall, should we worry about this?
- Tank treads :D
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Make small text thicker
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Someday I should implement protocol buffers
- Next-gen vecedit?
  - Multiple thing select
  - Select all
  - Move
  - Copy/paste
  - Show level/icon, clean with no controls or whatever
- Conditionals to makefiles so that the dependencies are only included if they're needed
- Multithread cache generation
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze, suicidal, triggerhappy, gunshy, bomber, perfect round, shutout, perfect shutout)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

Sounditude

Take a "queueSound" with Sound, volume, fade.
Sound gets loaded, much like dvec2.
Then there's IDBSoundPack items. This sounds good.

--- Boomerang
- Variables: toss width, intersection point
- Figure out an "angle" randomly, do the toss
- How do I make my math work here?
