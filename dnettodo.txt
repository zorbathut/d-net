---- Major work path
- Graphics glitch on tab culling in metagame_config
- Say when the last demo screen is up
- "Go back and edit" - explain how
- Why does enter work for P1?
- Crash when blowing away huge walls with 50 or 10-width wallripper
- Missing walls when doing same
- Faction info screen on startup
  - Add text
  - Add abilities
  - Add icon fading
  - Add random faction
- Gradual shop spawning
  - Remove bombardment from 2 player, make it cheaper for 3 and 4
- Pull glory explody into its own deploy?
- Next-gen weapons
- Faction bonuses/penalties in demo screens
- Training/certificates/discounts
- Many many more weapons
- Make small text thicker
- Implants?

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Cached shop demo stats
  - This is problematic because of all the various adjustments that can be on weapons
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon
- Color for projectile impacts

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Add tank sell depreciation
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression
