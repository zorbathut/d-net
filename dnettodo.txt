- "Polish the Damn Interface" Initiative
  - Four-weapon system
    - Figure out how to equip stuff well?
  - Colorcode tanks, based on relative tank level
  - vecedit should drag around with the right mouse button or whatever
  - walls that are more easily destroyed
  - support for really thin walls

---- After I figure out where it's going
- Need to sit down and rewrite the shop interface again.
  - Restricted speed/turn for the better tanks
    - Roll speed and handling together? Otherwise, come up with a description for the implant
    - "fast turn" "slow turn" modifier buttons?
  - Category descriptions somehow?

---- Sound-related stuff
- Need sound for game start sliders
- Need choose.wav and cursorover.wav
- accept.wav seems to start too late
- Eventually get things like weaponry sounds in

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Jittered tank could end up inside a wall, should we worry about this?
- Tank treads :D
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Make small text thicker
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Someday I should implement protocol buffers
- Next-gen vecedit?
  - Multiple thing select
  - Select all
  - Move
  - Copy/paste
  - Show level/icon, clean with no controls or whatever
- Conditionals to makefiles so that the dependencies are only included if they're needed
- Multithread cache generation
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze, suicidal, triggerhappy, gunshy, bomber, perfect round, shutout, perfect shutout)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

Sounditude

Take a "queueSound" with Sound, volume, fade.
Sound gets loaded, much like dvec2.
Then there's IDBSoundPack items. This sounds good.

--- Glory devices
None: Normal blast
Shaped Charges: big blast
Plasma Charge: blue spikes
Vengeance Pulse: Large shotgun blast towards the killing tank
Core Explosive: Plasma-charge-like shots out, energy DPS on impact
Stasis Chamber: Shrapnel blast of projectiles
Overload Chip: Lots of tesla spikes from the tank itself
Kamikaze Warhead: airbrake arcs, half-circles, explosions at the end
The Device: Fires out homing EMP DPS drones that include tesla spike generators
Deadman's Nuke: Angel-cannon explosion
Immolation Device: Multiple nearby explosions
Core Conversion: DPS explosion, with spew of airbrake projectiles

Okay, if we're doing a full menu GUI . . .

* Widget
Widget has a minsize, render, and input calls. Input includes mousein, mouseout, mouseclick, and key.

Everything can, I think, be inherited from this. We can have functors for handling events, like wxwidgets does, but I'll just rig it up so that items must pass their own events around. Everything will be noncopyable to make it easier.

Dump format

We need packets. Packet ID:

'I' - Init
'L' - Layout
'C' - Controls
'K' - Full checksum
'A' - Standard adler

IL(AK?CL?)*

Game start/end logic

- Player hasn't yet joined
  - Don't start or end the game ever

- Players are all "done" or "end"
  - Conform to player's wishes

- Players have all quit
  - Abort game, return to main menu
