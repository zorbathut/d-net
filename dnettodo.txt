How is *this* going to work?

Things it needs to do:

* Coordinate player choices
* Split up into 4 screens on demand
* Degenerate into 1 screen on demand
* Do complicated things based on the mode it's in


So:

* Keep status arrays and such
* For various modes, render shit differently
* Functions for the various contexts


---- Major work path
- Profit breakdown in final results
  - Test exponential cash starting adjustment
- Multishop
- Game joining, quitting, reconfiguring, hibernating
- Mine collision slowdown problems
- Mine halflife
- Better mine demo
- EMP demo
- Gradual shop spawning
  - Remove bombardment from 2 player, make it cheaper for 3 and 4
- Cached stats
- Next-gen collision/storage system on grid
- Pull glory explody into its own deploy?
- Next-gen weapons
- Faction info screen on startup
- Training/certificates/discounts
- Many many more weapons
- Implants

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Slide-along-walls track simulation?
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Abstract out tank manipulations into game_tank?
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- Enforce prefixes? projectile.blah etc etc etc
- Auto coord-to-float converter (CoordFloat?)
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon
- Color for projectile impacts
- Make explosion removals include the focus point

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Move stuff in tank small mode around a bit
- Add tank sell deprecation
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Halos?
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Level save snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
- dnd compression - this is going to rely on level save snapshots
