---- Major work path
- Figure out how I actually want new games to work
  - Start game at phase X
- Sound
- OSX/otherOS conversions
- Training/implants/wtf
- Next-gen vecedit?
- Activate factions
  - Faction bonuses/penalties in demo screens
- Many many more weapons
- Arcade mode
- Alliance mode? Faction mode?
- CTF
- King of the Hill
- Mutant
- Onslaught

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Category descriptions somehow?
- Item despawning based on wimpiest player
  - How does selling work?
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Make small text thicker
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Multithread cache generation
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Add tank sell depreciation
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze, suicidal, triggerhappy, gunshy, bomber)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

New game stuff

Junkyard 1000
Civilian 30000?
Professional 900000?
Military 2.7m
Exotic 81m
Experimental 2.4b
Ultimate 73b

Start game at point:
End game at point:
Approximate rounds to play:

How to calculate stuff? I'm not sure. log vs log, divide by rounds, exp or something?

lessee

exp((log(30000) - log(1000)) / rounds) = multiple

Where should this be? I think Interface, so I can start Metagame with these parameters. I guess I'll move the whole faction thing into that as well, I really don't think the battles work (as neat as the idea is.)
