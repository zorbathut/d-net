---- Major work path
- Bombardment info screen
- Upgrade info screen
- Glory device info screen
- Tank info screen
- Flavor text
- New weapons
- Next-gen collision/storage system on grid
- Logarithmic turning
- Improve explosion effects (missile, glory device)
- Certificates and discounts
- Training
- Implants
- Faction info screen on startup
- Make explosion removals include the focus point
- Multishop
- Many many more weapons

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Improved win sum system - what does this mean again?
- Slide-along-walls track simulation?
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- gfxeffects construction helper funcs
- Auto coord-to-float converter (CoordFloat?)
- AI shouldn't try to buy the glory device it already owns
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon
- Color for projectile impacts

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Add tank sell deprecation
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze)

---- Major but unimportant
- Halos?
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Level save snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
- dnd compression - this is going to rely on level save snapshots
