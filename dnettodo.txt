---- Major work path
- addr2line -i
- "Corrupted" bit for player, set on "force"?
- Scroll properly for equip (i.e. don't run past the bottom labels)
- Override sell instead of changing it
- Enough digits in the shop for cash on-hand
- AI should buy/sell/play with everything
- Render all tanks out
- Projectile reflecto
- Next-gen vecedit?
- Activate factions
  - Faction bonuses/penalties in demo screens
- Many many more weapons
- Arcade mode
- Alliance mode? Faction mode?
- CTF
- King of the Hill
- Mutant
- Onslaught

---- Sound-related stuff
- Need sound for game start sliders
- Need choose.wav and cursorover.wav
- accept.wav seems to start too late
- Eventually get things like weaponry sounds in

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Roll speed and handling together? Otherwise, come up with a description for the implant
- Category descriptions somehow?
- Item despawning based on wimpiest player
  - How does selling work?
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Make small text thicker
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Multithread cache generation
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze, suicidal, triggerhappy, gunshy, bomber, perfect round, shutout, perfect shutout)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

Sounditude

Take a "queueSound" with Sound, volume, fade.
Sound gets loaded, much like dvec2.
Then there's IDBSoundPack items. This sounds good.

Scrolling

Vertical location stored along with expandability
Set up a window around the draw zone - if there's "up", reserve room for text. Same with "down".

Scrolling happens when the cursor is high is low (whatever that means)
