- make unoptrun unoptai
- Improve separation for glory device demo
- Improve mine demo
- Move labels in EMP demo
- Start game at phase X
- Training/implants/wtf
- Activate factions
  - Faction bonuses/penalties in demo screens
- Many many more weapons
- Arcade mode
- Alliance mode? Faction mode?
- CTF
- King of the Hill
- Mutant
- Onslaught

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Category descriptions somehow?
- Item despawning based on wimpiest player
  - How does selling work?
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Cached shop demo stats
  - This is problematic because of all the various adjustments that can be on weapons
    - Record warhead impacts, replay?
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Make small text thicker
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Add tank sell depreciation
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze, suicidal, triggerhappy, gunshy, bomber)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

RNG stuff

metagame should really own its RNG. So it should simply have a *copy* of an RNG passed in, for it to own. Should Game own its RNG also? I'm honestly not sure. There are advantages.

If this is true, it means that Game and such need to pass RNGs around everywhere. But that's not really too hard.
