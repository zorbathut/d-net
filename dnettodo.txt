    - Make explosive radius bonus not apply to certain weapons
    - Change rockets to drones or something to emphasize exotic
      - Boost blast radius on drones

  - Remove the ability to sell?

- "Polish the Damn Interface" Initiative
  - Colorcode tanks, based on relative tank level
  - vecedit should drag around with the right mouse button or whatever
  - walls that are more easily destroyed
  - autocannons cause more wall damage
  - support for really thin walls
  - More permissive levels, more powerful editor catchall
    - Figure out how and when I can do genus-n levels, and allow that in one way or another (possibly chopping holey things in half?)
    - Allow subtractives
    - Try rebuilding the intersection system again? :/
    - Allow rings of some kind?
  - Add warning for single-node paths

- Run header culler again :D
- Netplay
- Add accuracy implant/upgrade?
- Less incentive to camp?
  - Reduce win/kill bonus as game goes on
- New game modes
  - Arcade mode
  - Alliance mode? Faction mode?
  - CTF
  - King of the Hill
  - Mutant
  - Onslaught
  - Bombing Run

---- After I figure out where it's going
- Need to sit down and rewrite the shop interface again.
  - Restricted speed/turn for the better tanks
    - Roll speed and handling together? Otherwise, come up with a description for the implant
    - "fast turn" "slow turn" modifier buttons?
  - Pop up "sell obsolete item" on buying bombardment/glory/new tank
  - Category descriptions somehow?

---- Sound-related stuff
- Need sound for game start sliders
- Need choose.wav and cursorover.wav
- accept.wav seems to start too late
- Eventually get things like weaponry sounds in

---- Things that take thought and musing
- Change things to "buy per 10sec" essentially?
- Tank treads :D
- Add better bombardment ticker
- Item despawning based on wimpiest player
  - How does selling work?
- FloatRange
  - This just takes some work - do this once I'm dealing with a lot of ranges again
- Make bombardment cheaper for 3 and 4 players
  - This is tough because of weird situations involving people buying/selling equipment before everyone's joined, after people leave, etc
- GameAccessors class
- Tweekvalues?
- Normalize controller to circle?
- Game inheritance/abstraction?
- Make DPS a little less flickery
- Improve win ticker so it displays overall totals somewhere maybe
- Demo screen for upgrades
- Physics for both pushing and tank-stuck-on-walls
- "Kill graph"

---- Maintenance, minor bugfix, braindead
- Make small text thicker
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- Set your keys/buttons changing
- AI shouldn't try to buy the items it already owns/smarter about shops
- Buy menu flicker? Double-buffering?
- Extricate coord.h and float.h from more headers
- De-inline stuff in coord.h and float.h
- Winner list better special effects
- Winner list better "null" icon

---- Things that may or may not be needed
- Someday I should implement protocol buffers
- Next-gen vecedit?
  - Multiple thing select
  - Select all
  - Move
  - Copy/paste
  - Show level/icon, clean with no controls or whatever
- Conditionals to makefiles so that the dependencies are only included if they're needed
- Multithread cache generation
- Add random faction
- Stop reloading files in findLevels
- Special unique bonuses (turned the most, closest to death, most/least accurate, traveler, tunneler, deadeye, kamikaze, suicidal, triggerhappy, gunshy, bomber, perfect round, shutout, perfect shutout)

---- Major but unimportant ATM
- Sound, yo
- Absolute mode config
- Holy crap! Self-intersecting! Cry!
- Consistent-ize line width effects, colors, rendering in general
- Snapshots - how should this work? I'm still not sure.
  - Netplay (NOTE: shop demos change random state!)
  - dnd compression

Sounditude

Take a "queueSound" with Sound, volume, fade.
Sound gets loaded, much like dvec2.
Then there's IDBSoundPack items. This sounds good.

String table stuff

Strtab("Hello")

Should somehow init a *global* parameter, and load things at the beginning of the program. Given a global init somehow I can do this.

This is not going to happen. We can, however, parse the source with an external program, then assemble that into a string-table file which is built into the program. It's a bit hacky but it will work.

---
Process:

* Read in itemdats. For the name, this is either done with prefix/suffix, or just alone. The rest has to be parsed specially.
* Read in kvds. Do the premerge step for everything besides warhead. Make sure to check for completeness, extra merges, etc.
* Do the warheads, write out file.
* Read in everything.
* Traverse over "everything" and see if the "value" needs to be multiplied in some way. If so, save the multiplier.
* Re-traverse and do warheads again, with multiplier. Write out file again.
* Read in everything, test values.
