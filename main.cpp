//
// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// That's all there is to initializing openGL!
// Now that you can display a triangle to the screen,
// you can go onto many other cool things from here.
// A lot of this (most of it) might be confusing the first time.
// The only stuff you should REALLY understand is the RenderScene() function.
// This function is what draws everything.  The rest of the stuff is init junk
// that you will very rarely ever look at again.  You might add a line here
// and there, but mostly it stays the same.  In the next tutorials, we will
// eventually just stick it in another .cpp file so we can just focus on the
// important stuff that we will most likely be changing a lot.  This will take
// the stress of being overwhelmed from the other stuff.  Like I said,
// if you can understand that you have a camera, and it points in a direction,
// and that you plot points to make a triangle, you are good for now :)
//
// Here are the basic steps to initializing OpenGL.
//
// 1) If you want to go full screen, give the option too.  Granted, the Full
//    screen code doesn't have anything to do with OpenGL, but I would always
//    encourage giving a full screen option.  It goes faster when it's in full
//    screen mode which helps out on slower computers.
//
// 2) Create our window with the full screen information.  We need to check if
//    the user wants full screen first because our window properties depend on it.
//
// 3) Next, we need to setup the pixel format.  This allows us to use openGL in 
//    our window.  We can also specify double buffering, if we want to draw to the
//    window, or a bitmap, and if we want to allow GDI function calls.  This is
//    necessary if we want to do anything with OpenGL.  You will most likely never
//    need to change the code in SetupPixelFormat().  It's a one time coded thing :)
//
// 4) Lastly, we need to setup our screen translations.  If we didn't use OpenGL 
//    this part would be complicated and tricky.  Luckily, OpenGL keeps us from
//      all the math needed to do the translations.  We just tell OpenGL how large
//    our viewport is (usually the whole screen) and which perspective we want to look
//      at out world. After that, we are all set and we just need to DRAW SOMETHING!
//
// We plotted 3 points in this tutorial.  3 points make up a triangle.
// We used the GL_TRIANGLES flag to tell OpenGL to render triangles.
// 
// Like so (cleaner):
//
//    glBegin (GL_TRIANGLES);    
//        glVertex3f(0, 1, 0);    // Top point            
//        glVertex3f(-1, 0, 0);    // Bottom right point
//        glVertex3f(1, 0, 0);    // Bottom left point
//    glEnd();
//
//  If we wanted 2 triangles, we could say:
//
//    glBegin (GL_TRIANGLES);    
//        glVertex3f(0, 1, 0);    // Top point            
//        glVertex3f(-1, 0, 0);    // Bottom right point

//  Here is a horrible attempt to draw the 3D axis's
//
//                Y
//                |
//                |
//                |________ X
//                 \
//                   \
//                    Z
//
//  This is drawn in a rotated manner so you can see the Z axis.
//  Otherwise it would be coming out of the screen and you couldn't see it.
//  Positive Z comes out of the screen towards us, where -z goes into the screen
//  Positive X is on the right, negative X is on the left
//  Positive Y goes straight up, where negative Y goes straight down
//
//  So here is what our triangle looks like with the axis
//                Y
//                |
//               /|\
//              /_|_\______ X
//                 \
//                   \
//                    Z
//
// As you can see, our triangle is half on the negative X side 
// and half on the positive X side.  It is also 0 on the Z axis,
// so really, it's really seen as 2D more than 3D because we
// aren't using the third dimension, which is Z.
//
// The next tutorial will be a lot smaller in comments because I will
// chop off all the stuff that I already explain, so then we can just focus
// on the RenderScene() function, rather than all the Init stuff. (Blah!)
//
// Once again, if it seems overwhelming.. it will get easier and MUCH more fun! 
//
// As for messing around with this tutorial, try changing camera positions
// to see how it effects your view.  Also, try plotting in other points and
// other triangles/lines/Quads (rectangles) to see what you can create so far.
//
// One last note about this code.  It might be a good idea, if you don't
// understand anything about 3D or matrices (matrix math) to go on the internet
// And do a little investigating and learning.  It couldn't hurt.  I will teach you
// all the math you will need to know, but the more versed you are in math, the better.
// If you are not good at math, or at least you don't know anything over algebra/geometry,
// you are going to get a little frustrated.  You will want to be pretty comfortable
// with cosine and sine, as well as plane and vector math.  You will want to know what
// a vector is, and what purpose it serves.  On my site I will most likely have a page
// dedicated to teaching 3D concepts, but if not when you read this, use the internet.
//
// Don't get scared if you are not a math person, I wasn't really when I first started
// doing 3D programming, but you learn REALLY fast, and it's fun when you use math
// to do something cool.  Yah, you heard me, math can be fun!
//
// 3D programming is by FAR the coolest thing to program.
