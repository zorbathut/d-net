# Devastation Net

Many years back, there was a game called Destruction Zone. You can find info about it at http://www.digitalscores.com/dzone/.

I played a lot of that game as kid.

Later, I decided to become an indie developer. I'd been playing projector games with friends, and of course Destruction Zone came up (we'd all played it, as it turned out). I decided to make a modernized version of it. And thus, Devastation Net.

In terms of development, and mostly in retrospect, there's a lot I did wrong. I lacked the discipline to sit down and finish a game. It was never finished, although it's actually rather fun. I've lost some interest in multiplayer development since then, and so it will probably never be polished.

But I spent a lot of hours on it.

So here it is.
