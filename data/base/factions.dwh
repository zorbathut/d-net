  data=The Disciples of Lucifer are a recent Satanist cult which believes pain and suffering are the path to redemption. They care deeply for their fellow humans and will do whatever it takes to save the souls of their brethren.
  data=This faction works hard to increase damage output for all weaponry. The increased warhead mass leaves less room for tank armor, which they gladly sacrifice in hopes that their own soul will be blessed.

  data=Serpent's Strike is a group of former race engineers and drivers entering D-Net for fame and money. They believe that the best way to win fights is to not be where the firepower is.
  data=Serpent tanks are fast and maneuverable. The tank's armor has been reduced slightly for even more speed. Serpent tanks are designed for precision strikes, and are not particularly good with trap and exotic weaponry.

  data=Aquear appears to have generally high technology, and has used this to build tanks which are superior in every way to the average tank. However, they appear unable to specialize, and their tanks are not outstanding in any way.
