This directory is where game controller dumps are stored. It's likely to get very, very big. If you're reading this, you're playing an incomplete version of the game anyway, so you should be expecting stuff like this.

Feel free to delete these whenever you want. If you use the commandline flag "--writeTarget=" it won't write them to begin with. If your game crashes, send me the most recent one.

If you don't know who "me" is, find out from the guy who sent this to you, or search Google for "Devastation Net" to find a more recent version. If it exists.
